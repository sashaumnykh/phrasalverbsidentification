wednesday = """
1
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:27,402
<i>I'm not sure
whose twisted idea it was
to put hundreds of adolescents
in underfunded schools
run by people whose dreams
were crushed years ago...</i>

4
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,041
<i>but I admire the sadism.</i>

5
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:05,648
I want names.

6
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,484
I don't know who they were, honest.

7
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,112
- It happened so fast.
- Pugsley, emotion equals weakness.

8
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:12,906
Pull yourself together.

9
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,658
Now.

10
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,789
You scared, kid? Scared?

11
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,046
You okay?

12
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,889
<i>I'm not about
to confess to my brother</i>

13
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:32,342
<i>that I've recently
been plagued by visions.</i>

14
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,385
<i>They come on without warning,</i>

15
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:38,348
<i>and feel like electroshock therapy,
but without the satisfying afterburn.</i>

16
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,933
Leave this to me.

17
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:41,016
Wednesday?

18
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,520
What are you gonna do?

19
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:44,938
What I do best.

20
00:01:56,574 --> 00:02:01,621
<i>♪ Non, rien de rien... ♪</i>

21
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:02,747
Yo, Dalton, look.

22
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,666
Pigsley's sister.

23
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,170
Hey, freak.

24
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:12,340
This is a closed practice.

25
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:15,593
The only person
who gets to torture my brother is me.

26
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:23,309
<i>♪ Non, rien de rien ♪</i>

27
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:29,107
<i>♪ Non, je ne regrette rien ♪</i>

28
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:34,612
<i>♪ Car ma vie, car mes joies ♪</i>

29
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:43,246
<i>♪ Ça commence avec toi ♪</i>

30
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,408
<i>♪ I close my eyes ♪</i>

31
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:07,538
<i>♪ Then I drift away ♪</i>

32
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:11,876
<i>♪ Into the magic night ♪</i>

33
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,338
<i>♪ I softly say ♪</i>

34
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:20,551
<i>♪ A silent prayer ♪</i>

35
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:24,514
<i>♪ Like dreamers do ♪</i>

36
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:29,352
<i>♪ Then I fall asleep to dream ♪</i>

37
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,272
<i>♪ My dreams of you ♪</i>

38
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,567
<i>♪ I remember ♪</i>

39
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:41,823
<i>♪ That you said goodbye... ♪</i>

40
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,501
Mmm.

41
00:04:56,713 --> 00:05:00,216
Darling, how long do you intend
on giving us the cold shoulder?

42
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,805
Lurch, please remind my parents
that I'm no longer speaking to them.

43
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,141
Hmm.

44
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,101
I promise you, my little viper,

45
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,687
you will love Nevermore.

46
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:13,688
Won't she, Tish?

47
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:16,024
Of course.
It's the perfect school for her.

48
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:19,235
Why? Because it was
the perfect school for you?

49
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,529
I have no interest
in following in your footsteps.

50
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,573
Becoming captain of the fencing team,

51
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,576
Queen of the Dark Prom,
President of the Séance Society.

52
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:31,205
I merely meant that finally you will
be among peers who understand you.

53
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,541
Maybe you'll even make some friends.

54
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,879
Nevermore is like
no other boarding school.

55
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,715
It's a magical place.

56
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,176
It's where I met your mother.

57
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,636
And we fell in love.

58
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,849
You guys are making me nauseous.

59
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:51,934
Not in a good way.

60
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:55,188
Darling, we aren't the ones
who got you expelled.

61
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:59,567
That boy's family was going to file
attempted murder charges.

62
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,778
How would that have looked on your record?

63
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:02,861
Terrible.

64
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,074
Everyone would know
I failed to get the job done.

65
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,201
Hmm.

66
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,290
Just over here is fine.

67
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:25,259
- Thanks.
- You sure you want to get out here?

68
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:30,181
The trail might look pretty,
but it runs right past Nevermore.

69
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,058
That school for outcasts?

70
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,560
Huh. That's a polite way of putting it.

71
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,021
I never had a problem with outcasts.

72
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,357
My counselor at summer camp
was a werewolf.

73
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,441
Great guy.

74
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,194
Yeah, they're just like you and me,

75
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,862
until they rip your throat out.

76
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,243
Thanks.

77
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:59,687
At least
it's turning into a beautiful day.

78
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,542
Wednesday is certainly a unique name.

79
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,795
I'm guessing it was the day you were born?

80
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,797
I was born on Friday the 13th.

81
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:30,843
Her name comes from a line
from my favorite nursery rhyme,

82
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,346
"Wednesday's child is full of woe."

83
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:39,977
You always had a unique perspective
on the world, Morticia.

84
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,061
Hmm.

85
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,648
Did your mother tell you
we were roommates back in the day?

86
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:47,151
And you graduated with your sanity intact?

87
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,528
Impressive.

88
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:53,407
You've certainly had
a very interesting educational journey.

89
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,284
Eight schools in five years.

90
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,162
They haven't built one
strong enough to hold me.

91
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,331
I bet this place won't be any different.

92
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:01,999
What our daughter is trying to say

93
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,752
is that she greatly appreciates
the opportunity.

94
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:11,259
Nevermore doesn't usually
accept students mid-term,

95
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:14,679
but given Wednesday's perfect grades

96
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:17,640
and your family's long history
with the school,

97
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,726
I've spoken with the board
and we've made an exception.

98
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,819
Larissa, what about Wednesday's, um...

99
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,071
therapy sessions?

100
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,282
The court ordered them.

101
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:38,119
Hmm. The school has a relationship
with a therapist in Jericho.

102
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:42,290
- She can meet twice a week.
- Did you hear that, my little storm cloud?

103
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,041
You're in excellent hands.

104
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,335
We'll see if she survives
the first session.

105
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,716
I've assigned you
to your mother's old dorm.

106
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:52,717
Ophelia Hall.

107
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,721
Refresh my memory.

108
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,639
Ophelia's the one who kills herself

109
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,517
after being driven mad
by her family, correct?

110
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,901
Should we go meet your new roommate?

111
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,494
It's so... vivid.

112
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,833
Howdy, roomie.

113
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:29,086
Wednesday, this is Enid Sinclair.

114
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,713
Are you feeling okay?

115
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,298
You look a little pale.

116
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,509
Wednesday always looks half-dead.

117
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:36,761
Oh.

118
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:38,888
Welcome to Ophelia Hall.

119
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,600
Not a hugger. Got it.

120
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,226
Please excuse Wednesday.

121
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,437
She's allergic to color.

122
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,688
Oh, wow.

123
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:49,690
What happens to you?

124
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:53,861
I break out into hives
and then the flesh peels off my bones.

125
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:57,657
Luckily, we've special ordered
you a uniform.

126
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,909
Enid, please take Wednesday
to the registrar's office

127
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,161
to pick it up along with her schedule,

128
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,246
and give her a tour along the way.

129
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:18,260
Nevermore was founded in 1791

130
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,970
to educate people like us.

131
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,722
Outcasts, freaks, monsters,

132
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,725
fill in your favorite
marginalized group here.

133
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,936
You can save the sanitized sales pitch.

134
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,356
- I don't plan on staying here for long.
- Why not?

135
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,024
This was my parents' idea.

136
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:35,111
Oh look, there's my mother smirking at me.

137
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,197
They've been looking for any excuse
to send me here.

138
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:42,243
It's all a part of their nefarious,
yet completely obvious plan.

139
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:43,369
What plan?

140
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,038
To turn me into a version of themselves.

141
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:49,375
In that case,
perhaps you can clear something up.

142
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,604
Rumor's been swirling around
that you killed a kid at your old school,

143
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,505
and your parents pulled strings
to get you off.

144
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:56,841
Actually, it was two kids,
but who's counting?

145
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,638
Welcome to the quad.

146
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,101
It's a pentagon.

147
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:12,022
The whole snarky Goth girl thing
might have worked at normie school,

148
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,733
but here things are different.

149
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,944
Let me give you a wiki
on Nevermore's social scene.

150
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:20,865
I'm not interested in participating
in tribal adolescent clichés.

151
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:24,618
Well, then use it to fill
your obviously bottomless pit of disdain.

152
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,954
There are many flavors of outcasts here,

153
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:30,207
but the four main cliques are
Fangs, Furs, Stoners and Scales.

154
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,378
Those are the Fangs, AKA vampires.

155
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:37,465
Some of them have literally
been here for decades.

156
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:41,677
That bunch of knuckleheads are Furs,
AKA werewolves.

157
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,971
Like me!

158
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:46,348
Full moons get pretty loud around here.

159
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,641
That's when Furs wolf out.

160
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,186
I suggest you pick up
noise-cancelling headphones.

161
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,313
I'm assuming Scales are sirens?

162
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,148
You catch on quick.

163
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,858
And that girl, Bianca Barclay,

164
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,611
is the closest thing
Nevermore has to royalty.

165
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,782
Although her crown's been slipping lately.

166
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,868
She used to date our resident
tortured artist, Xavier Thorpe.

167
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,204
But they broke up
at the beginning of the semester.

168
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,039
Reason unknown.

169
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,249
- Fascinating.
- I know, right?

170
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,711
My vlog is, like, the number one source
for Nevermore gossip.

171
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,340
Yo, Enid! You're not gonna believe
the dirt I heard about your new roommate.

172
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,550
She eats human flesh.

173
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,552
Chowed down on that kid she murdered.

174
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,262
You better watch your back.

175
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,473
Quite the contrary.

176
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,433
I actually fillet
the bodies of my victims,

177
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,644
then feed them to my menagerie of pets.

178
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,731
Ajax, this is my new roommate, Wednesday.

179
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,024
Whoa.

180
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,277
You're in black and white.

181
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,322
- Like a living Instagram filter.
- Ignore him.

182
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,491
Gorgons spend way too much time
getting stoned.

183
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,201
He's cute, but clueless.

184
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,703
It's a small school.
There wasn't much online about you.

185
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,540
You should really get on Insta,
Snapchat and TikTok.

186
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:57,378
I find social media to be a soul-sucking
void of meaningless affirmation.

187
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,804
Look at you, my little deathtrap.

188
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:11,141
Seeing you in this uniform brings back
so many terrible memories.

189
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,060
- Doesn't it, Tish?
- Yes.

190
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,814
Why don't you boys wait in the car?

191
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,191
Wednesday and I need a moment.

192
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,365
Pugsley,

193
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,327
you're soft and weak.

194
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:33,956
You'll never survive without me.
I give you two months, tops.

195
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,458
I'm gonna miss you, too, sis.

196
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:47,553
Any plans you have of running away
end right now.

197
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,848
I've alerted all family members

198
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:54,685
to contact me
the minute you darken their doorstep.

199
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,813
You have nowhere to go.

200
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,524
As usual, you underestimate me, Mother.

201
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,652
I will escape
this educational penitentiary,

202
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,696
and you will never hear from me again.

203
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,991
You are a brilliant girl, Wednesday,

204
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,243
but sometimes you get in your own way.

205
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:16,916
I'm sure you'll grow to love Nevermore,

206
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:21,295
and find it as life-changing as I did.

207
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:26,967
Oh, I got you a little something.

208
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,763
W...

209
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,181
M.

210
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,683
Our initials.

211
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,478
It's made of obsidian,

212
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,774
which Aztec priests
used to conjure visions.

213
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,319
It's a symbol of our connection.

214
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,158
Which one of your spirits
suggested this toe-curling tchotchke?

215
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,994
I'm not you, Mother.

216
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:58,582
I will never fall in love,
or be a housewife, or have a family.

217
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:04,546
I'm told girls your age
say hurtful things,

218
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,799
and I shouldn't take it to heart.

219
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,635
Fortunately, you don't have one.

220
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:15,057
Finally, a kind word for your mother.

221
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,939
Lurch, the crystal ball, please.

222
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,028
We can't talk to you for the first week
while you're settling in,

223
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,489
so we'll call you next Sunday.

224
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,684
Don't worry, my love.

225
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,520
Our little scorpion won't be alone.

226
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,547
Where's the rest of him?

227
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,884
Well, the torso and arm are over there.

228
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,636
We found a leg by the lake.

229
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,639
There's an arm in that tree over there,

230
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,350
and the rest of the parts
are so far unaccounted for.

231
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,771
It matches the profile
of the other two attacks last week.

232
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:48,067
All right, issue a warning.
Keep hikers out of the woods.

233
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,487
Don't approve any more campfire permits
for the foreseeable future.

234
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,489
What do you want me to tell the press?

235
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,784
You know they're going to be
swarming like mosquitos in July.

236
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:00,788
- Tell them the bear is back.
- You don't believe that, Sheriff.

237
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:01,872
No, I don't.

238
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,250
Whatever did this wasn't human.

239
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,288
Look, I know these murders
are connected to Nevermore.

240
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,464
I just can't prove it yet. So until I can...

241
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,717
it's a goddamn bear.

242
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,651
What the hell did you do to my room?

243
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,445
Dividing<i> our</i> room equally.

244
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,534
It looks like a rainbow
vomited on your side.

245
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,869
- I...
- Silence would be appreciated.

246
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,621
This is my writing time.

247
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,123
Your writing time?

248
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,416
I devote an hour a day to my novel.

249
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,628
Perhaps if you did the same,
your vlog might be coherent.

250
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:52,631
I've read serial killer diaries
with better punctuation.

251
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,341
I write in my voice.

252
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:57,219
It's my truth.
It's what my followers love.

253
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,555
Your followers are clearly imbeciles.

254
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:03,600
They respond to your stories
with insipid little pictures.

255
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,269
Uh, you mean, emojis?

256
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:09,481
It's how people express their feelings.
I realize that's a foreign concept to you.

257
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:14,486
When I look at you,
the following emojis come to mind.

258
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,447
Rope, shovel, hole.

259
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,617
By the way, there are two D's in Addams.

260
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:24,329
If you're going to gossip about me,
at least spell my name correctly.

261
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,125
Turn that off.

262
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,921
This is your final warning.

263
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,131
Rawr!

264
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:36,341
Don't mess with me.

265
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:40,137
This kitty's got claws,
and I'm not afraid to use them.

266
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,681
Good evening, girls.

267
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,725
Oh, sorry about the mud.

268
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:48,520
I wanted to make sure
that Wednesday was settling in.

269
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:55,569
Ah. Is this a bad time?

270
00:19:57,321 --> 00:20:00,115
I'm Ms. Thornhill, your dorm mom.

271
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,993
Apologies, I wasn't here
to greet you when you arrived.

272
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:05,871
I trust Enid has given you
the old Nevermore welcome.

273
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,873
She's been smothering me with hospitality.

274
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:09,958
I hope to return the favor.

275
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,044
In her sleep.

276
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:17,466
Well, here's a little welcome gift
from my conservatory.

277
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,802
I try to match the right flower
to each of my girls.

278
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,138
When I read your personal statement
in your application,

279
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,932
I immediately thought of this one.

280
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,141
The black dahlia.

281
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,267
Oh, you know it?

282
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:30,103
Of course. It's named after
my favorite unsolved murder.

283
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,231
Thank you.

284
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,985
Okey-dokey. Before I leave,
I want to go over a few house rules.

285
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,905
Lights off at 10:00, no loud music,

286
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,157
and no boys, ever.

287
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,451
What's the story
about going into the local town?

288
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:47,287
Passes to Jericho
are a privilege, not a right.

289
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:51,124
It's a brisk 25-minute walk,
or there's a shuttle on the weekends.

290
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:54,878
The locals are a tad bit wary
about Nevermore,

291
00:20:54,962 --> 00:21:00,884
so please don't go making any waves,
or perpetuating any outcast stereotypes.

292
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:05,138
That means keep your claws to yourself,
and no smothering people in their sleep.

293
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:06,723
Are we clear?

294
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:10,769
Great talk.

295
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:44,177
Coach, Coach, she tripped me.

296
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,805
It was a clean strike, Rowan.

297
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:50,017
Maybe if you whined less
and practiced more, you wouldn't suck.

298
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,978
Seriously, Coach, when am I
gonna get real competition?

299
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,938
Anyone else want to challenge me?

300
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,023
I do.

301
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:01,194
Oh, you must be
the psychopath they let in.

302
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,071
You must be the self-appointed Queen Bee.

303
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:07,284
Interesting thing about bees.
Pull out their stingers, they drop dead.

304
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:08,618
Ooh!

305
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,122
Rowan doesn't need you
to come to his defense.

306
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:15,292
- He's not helpless, he's lazy.
- Are we doing this or not?

307
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,257
<i>En garde.</i>

308
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,327
Point to Wednesday.

309
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,044
The score is even.

310
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:05,675
That first point
was clearly beginner's luck.

311
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:07,761
Let's finish this.

312
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:12,140
For the final point, I would like
to invoke a military challenge.

313
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,141
No masks.

314
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,559
- No tips.
- Ooh.

315
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:18,522
Winner draws first blood.

316
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,153
It's your decision, Bianca.

317
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,701
Let's see if you bleed in black and white.

318
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:08,905
Your face finally got that splash
of color it so desperately needed.

319
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:20,750
You're Wednesday, right?

320
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,004
Rowan.

321
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,592
- I know how you feel.
- I guarantee you don't.

322
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,970
My mother promised me
I'd finally fit in somewhere.

323
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:38,435
I never thought it was possible to be
an outcast in a school full of outcasts.

324
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:42,314
But it looks like you're gonna
give me a run for my money.

325
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,024
Uh...

326
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:46,735
Sorry about the... nick.

327
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,904
No good deed goes unpunished.

328
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,060
Wednesday!

329
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,237
Welcome back.

330
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,032
Just take it easy.

331
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:38,828
Nurse said you don't have a concussion,
but you probably have a nasty bump, huh?

332
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:41,164
The last thing I remember
I was walking outside

333
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:44,084
feeling a mixture of rage,
pity and self-disgust.

334
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:46,795
I never felt that way before.

335
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,506
Losing to Bianca
has that effect on people, I think.

336
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:52,926
Then I looked up and saw
that gargoyle coming down and I thought,

337
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:55,136
"At least I'll have an imaginative death."

338
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,723
Then you tackled me out of the way.

339
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:00,599
Why?

340
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,311
Call it instinct.

341
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:06,523
So you were guided by latent chivalry,

342
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:09,693
the tool of the patriarchy,
to extract my undying gratitude?

343
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:12,070
Mm-hmm. Most people just say thank you.

344
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:13,488
I didn't want to be rescued.

345
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,782
I shoulda just let that thing
smash you to mush?

346
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:19,411
- I would have rather saved myself.
- Good to see you haven't changed.

347
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,665
If makes you feel any better,
let's just say I returned the favor.

348
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,041
Xavier Thorpe?

349
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:27,919
You probably don't remember me.

350
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:31,423
Last time we met, I was about
two feet shorter, 40 pounds heavier.

351
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:32,674
What happened?

352
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:36,469
- Puberty, I guess.
- What happened the last time we met?

353
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:38,305
Oh. Uh.

354
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,141
Yeah, it... it was my godmother's funeral.

355
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:45,020
She was friends with your grandmother,
and they spent their twenties in Europe,

356
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:47,772
swindling the rich and notorious.

357
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,985
I don't know,
but we were ten, and we were bored,

358
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,321
decided to play hide and seek.

359
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:57,741
I had the inspired idea
to hide in her casket.

360
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:59,704
I got stuck
as it was headed to the crematorium.

361
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:00,785
I'd heard muffled screams.

362
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,788
I just figured
your godmother had cheated death

363
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,624
and was trying to claw her way out.

364
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,459
Either way,
you hit the big red stop button

365
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:09,836
and saved me from being flame-broiled. So...

366
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,422
now we're even.

367
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:21,056
<i>♪ Ay de mí, Llorona ♪</i>

368
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:26,478
<i>♪ Llorona, tú eres mi chunca ♪</i>

369
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,733
<i>♪ Ay de mí, Llorona ♪</i>

370
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:36,863
<i>♪ Llorona, tú eres mi chunca... ♪</i>

371
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:39,448
I knew it!

372
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,117
Hello, Thing.

373
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:48,291
Did you think my highly trained
olfactory sense wouldn't pick up

374
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:52,170
on the faint whiff of neroli and bergamot
in your favorite hand lotion?

375
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,589
I could do this all day.

376
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:57,842
Surrender?

377
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:04,391
Mother and Father sent you
to spy on me, didn't they?

378
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:08,019
I'm not above breaking a few fingers.

379
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,065
That they thought I wouldn't find out
proves how much they underestimate me.

380
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:15,860
Oh, Thing, you poor, naive appendage.

381
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,363
My parents aren't worried about me.

382
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:19,446
They're evil puppeteers

383
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,366
who want to pull my strings
even from afar.

384
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,828
The way I see it, you have two options.

385
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,621
Option one.

386
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:30,500
I lock you in here
for the rest of the semester,

387
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:34,129
and you go slowly insane
trying to claw your way out,

388
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,589
ruining your nails
and your smooth, supple skin.

389
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,591
And we both know how vain you are.

390
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:39,759
Option two.

391
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:42,971
You pledge your undying loyalty to me.

392
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:46,015
<i>♪ ...que no se apartan de mí... ♪</i>

393
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:52,439
Our first order of business
is to escape this teenage purgatory.

394
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,066
Of course I have a plan.

395
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:57,986
And it begins now.

396
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,392
Dr. Kinbott's office
is on the second floor.

397
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,603
Other Nevermore students swear by her.

398
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:34,272
You'll be here until I'm done?

399
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:37,901
Perhaps afterwards we can visit
the Weathervane for hot chocolate.

400
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:41,237
Principal Weems, this feeble attempt
at bonding is beneath you.

401
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:47,410
And chauffeuring your students around
is below your pay grade.

402
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:51,247
Given your history,
I'm sure you're intent on running away.

403
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,627
I'm here to prevent that from happening.

404
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:58,713
I wish you luck.

405
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:05,512
I read the notes
from your school counselor.

406
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:08,681
Mrs. Bronstein. She had
a nervous breakdown after our last session

407
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,725
and had to take a six-month sabbatical.

408
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:13,061
Go ahead and take a seat.

409
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,689
How did you feel about that?

410
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:17,899
Vindicated.

411
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,860
But someone who crochets
for a hobby isn't a worthy adversary.

412
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:22,779
Adversary?

413
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:26,366
I hope we can forge a relationship
based on trust and mutual respect.

414
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:28,827
This is a safe space, Wednesday.

415
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,329
A sanctuary where we can discuss anything.

416
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:33,581
What you're thinking, feeling,

417
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,750
your views on the world,
personal philosophy.

418
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:39,128
That's easy.
I think that this is a waste of time.

419
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,881
I see the world
as a place that must be endured,

420
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:44,551
and my personal philosophy
is kill or be killed.

421
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:47,679
So, for instance,
when someone bullies your brother,

422
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:50,014
your response is
to dump piranha in the pool.

423
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:53,184
You know the old saying,
never bring a knife to a sword fight.

424
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,687
Unless it's concealed.

425
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:59,032
Point is, you assaulted a boy,
and showed no remorse for your actions.

426
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,776
- That's why you're here.
- He lost a testicle.

427
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:05,655
I did the world a favor.
People like Dalton shouldn't procreate.

428
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:07,490
I've answered all your questions.

429
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:09,409
We're not done yet.

430
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:15,999
Therapy is a valuable tool
to help you understand yourself.

431
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:18,501
It can teach you new ways
to deal with your emotions.

432
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:21,129
It can also help you build
a life that you want.

433
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,922
I know the life that I want.

434
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,591
Tell me about it.

435
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:29,345
Everything said in these sessions
is strictly confidential.

436
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,434
Do your plans involve becoming an author?

437
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,269
I understand you've written three novels

438
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:38,938
about a teen girl detective,
Viper De La Muerte.

439
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,441
Can you tell me about her?

440
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:44,068
Viper is smart, perceptive,
chronically misunderstood.

441
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,904
Any luck getting your work published?

442
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,658
Editors are short-sighted,
fear-based life forms.

443
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,119
One once described my writing
as gratuitously morbid,

444
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:55,121
and suggested I seek psychiatric help.

445
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,205
Hmm.

446
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,498
Ironic, isn't it?

447
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,542
How did you take that?

448
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,670
I sent her a "thank you."

449
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:13,848
I've always been open
to constructive criticism.

450
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:15,850
I'm glad to hear that.

451
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:19,437
Because I was sent the manuscripts
as part of your psych evaluation.

452
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,397
The relationship I found most intriguing

453
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,608
was that of Viper
and her mother, Dominica.

454
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:26,486
Why don't we dig into that?

455
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:32,784
Part of this journey requires us
going to uncomfortable places emotionally.

456
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,077
I don't travel well.

457
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:38,498
Would you mind if I use
the powder room first?

458
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:51,843
Wednesday?

459
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:53,346
Is everything okay?

460
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,558
You can't hide
for the rest of the session.

461
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:58,682
I'm all right.

462
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:02,355
Just preparing myself
for our uncomfortable journey.

463
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:04,982
Nail file.

464
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:33,553
On Saturday, I can do in the afternoon,
sometime around four o'clock?

465
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,443
Who let you out?

466
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,403
You goddamn weirdo.

467
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,086
Holy crap!

468
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,048
Do you make a habit
of scaring the hell out of people?

469
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,466
It's more of a hobby.

470
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:13,885
You go to Nevermore.

471
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,721
Didn't realize they changed the uniform.

472
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:18,097
I need a quad over ice.

473
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:19,182
It's an emergency.

474
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:22,935
It's four shots of espresso.

475
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,687
Yeah, I... I know what a quad is,

476
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:28,232
but, spoiler alert,
the espresso machine's having a seizure,

477
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,567
so all we have is drip.

478
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,778
But drip is for people who hate themselves

479
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:34,197
and know their lives
have no real purpose or meaning.

480
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:39,327
What's wrong with your machine?

481
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,621
It's a temperamental beast
with a mind of its own,

482
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:44,540
and it doesn't help
that the instructions are in Italian.

483
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:53,257
I need a tri-wing screwdriver
and a four-millimeter Allen wrench.

484
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,510
Wait, you read Italian?

485
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,930
Of course.
It's the native tongue of Machiavelli.

486
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:02,308
Here's the deal.
I'm going to fix your coffee machine,

487
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:04,435
then you're going to make my coffee
and call a taxi.

488
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:07,855
Uh, no taxis in Jericho.

489
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:08,940
Try Uber?

490
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:12,026
I don't have a phone.
I refuse to be a slave to technology.

491
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,529
Then you're out of luck.

492
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,155
Where you going anyway?

493
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:19,242
That's on a need-to-know basis.
What about trains?

494
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:23,246
Nearest station is Burlington.
It's half an hour away.

495
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:25,873
You have a valve issue.
I've seen it before.

496
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:29,418
Where? You have
one of these monsters at home?

497
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:32,338
Steam-powered guillotine.
I built it when I was ten.

498
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,424
I wanted to decapitate my dolls
more efficiently.

499
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:39,219
Sure.

500
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,973
Grim Reaper Barbie, makes perfect sense.

501
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:47,019
Wow.

502
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:48,645
Thanks.

503
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,858
I never met a Nevermore kid
who got their hands dirty.

504
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:55,528
I'm Tyler, by the way.

505
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:58,823
I didn't catch your name,
or is that on a need-to-know basis too?

506
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:01,449
Wednesday.

507
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,035
Tell you what, Wednesday.

508
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,330
To show my appreciation,
how about I drive you to Burlington?

509
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,875
Perfect. Put that quad in a to-go cup.

510
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:11,419
Uh, but I don't get off for another hour.

511
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:14,589
I'll sweeten the pot.

512
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:17,508
Twenty whole dollars...

513
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,051
Tempting, but no.

514
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,430
I'll make it 40.

515
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:23,513
Uh...

516
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:27,560
Listen, Wednesday, one fun fact about me...

517
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:32,773
I can't be bought, so either wait,
or find someone else to drive you.

518
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:54,670
What happened?

519
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,886
Hey, boys, check it out.

520
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:03,095
- Who's that?
- Bro...

521
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,180
Come on.

522
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,427
What's a Nevermore freak
doing out in the wild?

523
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,812
This is our booth.

524
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:14,690
Why are you dressed
like religious fanatics?

525
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:18,027
- We're pilgrims.
- Potato, po-tah-to.

526
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,403
We work at Pilgrim World.

527
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:26,285
It takes a special kind of stupid
to devote an entire theme park

528
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,537
to zealots responsible for mass genocide.

529
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:31,207
My dad owns Pilgrim World.

530
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:32,667
Who you calling stupid?

531
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,002
If the buckled shoe fits.

532
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,504
Guys, back off.

533
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,798
- Stay out of this, Galpin.
- Yes, stay out of this.

534
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:42,760
So tell me, freak...

535
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:46,389
you ever been with a normie?

536
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:49,141
I've never found one that could handle me.

537
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,063
- Boo!
- Hey!

538
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,544
So where'd you learn those kung fu moves?

539
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:17,867
My uncle taught me.

540
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,506
He spent five years
in a Tibetan Monastery.

541
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,383
Was he a monk?

542
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:23,466
Prisoner.

543
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:26,261
Dad!

544
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,849
Tyler, the hell's going on in here?

545
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:33,394
They were harassing a customer,
and she put them in their place.

546
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,481
This little thing took down three boys?

547
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,483
Did you help her?

548
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:42,194
Dad, I swear, I wasn't involved.

549
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:44,988
Apologies, Sheriff.

550
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,991
This one slipped away from me.

551
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:48,951
Come on, Miss Addams, time to go.

552
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,204
Wait a minute, hang on.

553
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:55,374
You're an Addams?

554
00:38:57,543 --> 00:39:00,129
Don't tell me Gomez Addams is your father?

555
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:04,342
That man belongs behind bars for murder.

556
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:07,345
Guessin' the apple
doesn't fall far from the tree.

557
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,348
I'm gonna keep my eye on you.

558
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,099
Okay.

559
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,732
Your first day and you're already
on Sheriff Galpin's radar.

560
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:23,361
- Wish I could say I was surprised.
- What did he mean about my father?

561
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:26,155
I have no idea, but a word of advice.

562
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:29,158
Stop making enemies
and start making a few friends.

563
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,285
You're going to need them.

564
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,165
Looks like an accident.

565
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:38,459
I hope the driver's okay.

566
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:40,920
He's dead.

567
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:43,214
Broke his neck.

568
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,468
How can you tell from this angle?

569
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,120
No, I don't really feel better.

570
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,457
There's just something wrong
about this place.

571
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,125
Not just because it's a school.

572
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:29,463
How the hell did you get that
oversized violin out the window?

573
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,423
I had an extra hand.

574
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:34,385
Whoa.

575
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,303
Where's the rest of him?

576
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,889
It's one of the great
Addams family mysteries.

577
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,151
Why aren't you wolfing out?

578
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:53,571
Because I can't.

579
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:56,864
It's all I got.

580
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:04,248
My mom says some wolves are late bloomers,
but I've been to the best Lycanologist.

581
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:06,792
I had to fly to Milwaukee,
would you believe it?

582
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:10,796
Yeah, she says
there's a chance I may never...

583
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:12,714
you know.

584
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:16,051
What happens then?

585
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:18,721
I'd become a lone wolf.

586
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:22,474
Sounds perfect.

587
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:25,811
Are you kidding me?
My life would be officially over.

588
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:29,690
I'd be kicked out of my family pack
with no prospect of finding a mate.

589
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:33,235
- I'm failing to see the problem here.
- I could die alone.

590
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,614
We all die alone, Enid.

591
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:40,868
You really suck at this.

592
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,202
Cheering people up.

593
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,876
- Why are you crying?
- Because I'm upset!

594
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:52,504
Haven't you ever cried,
or are you above that too?

595
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:00,137
It was the week after Halloween.

596
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:04,725
I was six years old.

597
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:09,730
I took my pet scorpion, Nero,
out for his afternoon stroll,

598
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,065
and we were ambushed.

599
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:19,281
<i>They wondered what kind of freak
would have a scorpion for a pet.</i>

600
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:20,365
Yeah.

601
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,788
<i>Two of them held me down
and made me watch...</i>

602
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:38,842
...while the others ran Nero over until...

603
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:50,145
<i>It was snowing
when I buried what was left of him.</i>

604
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:55,275
<i>I cried my little black heart out.</i>

605
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:02,574
<i>But tears don't fix anything.</i>

606
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,955
So I vowed to never do it again.

607
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:18,674
Your secret's safe with me.

608
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,595
Still think you're weird as shit, though.

609
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:26,014
The feeling is incredibly mutual.

610
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:32,438
How would you like your single room back?

611
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:34,982
You just need to show me
how to use your computer.

612
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:49,788
Holy shit!

613
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,010
Okay.

614
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:08,599
Okay, I'm taking orders from a hand.

615
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:12,019
This isn't weird at all.

616
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:24,573
<i>Uh... hi.</i>

617
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:26,742
That's Thing.

618
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:30,287
Is he, like, your pet?

619
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:33,791
<i>He's sensitive.</i>

620
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:37,336
Look, I know Nevermore
is ground zero for all things weird,

621
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:39,838
but this is next-level.

622
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:43,634
So, what happened to not
wanting to be a slave to technology?

623
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:44,927
<i>Desperate times.</i>

624
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,610
Are you still willing to help me escape?

625
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:50,057
<i>After what happened today,
I figured they'd have you in solitary.</i>

626
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:53,560
There's the Harvest Festival this weekend.
Attendance is mandatory.

627
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,062
I'm going to use it as a cover.

628
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,356
If you're willing
to drive me to the station,

629
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:58,982
I can make it worth your while.

630
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:02,820
I'm in.

631
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:04,822
And no charge.

632
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:06,240
Consider it a freebie.

633
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:08,367
<i>Why?</i>

634
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,035
'Cause I wish I was going with you.

635
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,705
At least one of us
will get out of this hellhole town.

636
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:27,719
Are you sure you can trust that normie?

637
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:30,013
Dad, I didn't know
they were gonna be here.

638
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:32,307
I trust that I can handle myself.

639
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:34,672
I don't want you talking to her.
I want you home by 12:00.

640
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:36,311
- 1:00.
- 12:30.

641
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:37,395
Well,

642
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:40,440
good luck and safe travels.

643
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:44,236
Still not a hugger. Got it.

644
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:22,858
Jeez, you get any better at this,
you'll be taking home a whole pack.

645
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:25,652
Pandas don't travel in packs.
They prefer solitude.

646
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:28,655
All right. Subtle hint taken.

647
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:32,492
You should know I'm waiting for someone.

648
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:35,454
Oh yeah, who's the lucky guy... or girl?

649
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:37,080
What does it matter to you?

650
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:40,667
Didn't mean to interrupt.

651
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:41,751
You're not.

652
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:47,104
This is gonna be trickier than I thought.

653
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:50,069
Dad hit me with a curfew. We need to go
if I'm gonna make it back in time.

654
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:52,471
I've got some dead weight
I need to lose first.

655
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:56,600
Meet me behind the parking lot
when the fireworks start.

656
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,981
You see that sad, lonely woman over there?

657
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:07,069
She needs this pathetic validation
more than I do.

658
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:09,529
Would you mind distracting her?

659
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:15,160
<i>I love you. I love you.</i>

660
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:29,299
Hey, before you leave,
I wanted you to have this.

661
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:33,136
It's your dad's police file
from when he was at Nevermore.

662
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:35,305
I think it's the reason my dad hates him.

663
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,308
You okay?

664
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:43,146
I'm not used to people engaging with me.

665
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,816
Most see me coming and cross the street.

666
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:47,901
You're not scary. You're just kinda...

667
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:50,569
kooky.

668
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:53,824
I prefer spooky.

669
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:54,907
Oh.

670
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:58,161
Now my train leaves in an hour.
We're burning moonlight.

671
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:00,664
Uh, right, right.

672
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,250
Hey.

673
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:07,295
Come on, Wednesday. Wednesday!

674
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:09,172
We can lose them in the crowd.

675
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:23,603
Oh, whoa!

676
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:38,452
Shit.

677
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:40,328
Wednesday, we need to go.

678
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:41,788
Wednesday, come on.

679
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,416
- Wednesday!
- Rowan, come back!

680
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,432
Rowan, wait!

681
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:03,560
What do you want?
Why are you following me?

682
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:06,104
I don't have time to explain,
but you're in danger.

683
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,695
I think you've got it backwards.

684
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,621
- You're the one who's in danger.
- What are you doing?

685
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:24,331
Saving everyone from you.

686
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:25,665
I have to kill you.

687
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:29,211
The gargoyle, that was you?

688
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:30,295
Yeah.

689
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:33,256
It's always the quiet ones.

690
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:40,013
Girl in the picture. That's you.

691
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:47,155
You want to kill me
because of some picture?

692
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:51,817
My mother drew that picture 25 years ago
when she was a student at Nevermore.

693
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,819
She was a powerful Seer.

694
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:58,782
- Told me about it before she died.
- Rowan, put me down.

695
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:01,118
No! My mother said it was my destiny

696
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:03,578
to stop this girl
if she ever came to Nevermore,

697
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:07,040
because she will
destroy the school and everyone in it.

698
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:10,293
Rowan.

699
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:11,711
Rowan.

700
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:24,534
<i>Hello, my little black cloud.</i>

701
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:28,663
<i>So tell us darling,
how was your first week?</i>

702
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:30,916
<i>Let's see.</i>

703
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:33,168
<i>I narrowly avoided death twice,</i>

704
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:35,879
<i>discovered that my father
may be a murderer,</i>

705
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:38,590
<i>learned that I could
potentially destroy the school,</i>

706
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:41,927
<i>and was mysteriously saved
by a homicidal monster.</i>

707
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:45,680
As much as it pains me to admit,
you were right, Mother.

708
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:48,683
I think I'm going to love it here.

709
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:56,399
<i>This season on</i> Wednesday...

710
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:58,902
<i>This story's
about to take a dark turn.</i>

711
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:01,195
<i>Luckily,</i>

712
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:03,823
<i>I'm not afraid of the dark.</i>

713
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,370
There's a monster out there,
but everyone believes I made it all up.

714
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:11,581
<i>I need to find something
that can prove I haven't lost my mind.</i>

715
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:15,585
<i>You're really obsessed with
this monster-in-the-woods thing.</i>

716
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:18,546
Would you rather I develop an obsession
with horses and boy bands?

717
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:21,341
So, tell us everything.

718
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:24,928
<i>Since you've abandoned me,
I've been hunted, haunted,</i>

719
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:26,930
and the target of an attempted murder.

720
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:30,517
Ah, Nevermore, I love you so!

721
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:37,190
How do you manage to end up at the center
of every terrible thing that happens here?

722
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:38,358
Incredible luck.

723
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:41,837
<i>You insisted
I go to this school.</i>

724
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:44,281
<i>Did you really think
I wouldn't find out your secret?</i>

725
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:45,657
You don't know the full story.

726
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:49,494
When I suggested giving
your side of the room a makeover,

727
00:54:49,577 --> 00:54:52,998
I did not have
Ted Bundy's Pinterest in mind. Ew.

728
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:56,084
<i>This ends now.</i>

729
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,593
If you hear me screaming bloody murder,

730
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:07,595
there's a good chance
I'm just enjoying myself.

731
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:10,265
<i>Watch all episodes now.</i>
